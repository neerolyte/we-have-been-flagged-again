# we-have-been-flagged-again
Conflicting interest groups have flagged us again - it is likely that they will pressure github to take us down

OK - so - conflicting groups have flagged my account for madChopsCoderAu

It is really unfortunate because I was just trying to make a common free space for Australian coders.

A space where money and corporations weren't in control.
A space where we could have fun, help each other and so on ....

If you want to help, please contace github and ask them to unflag and review @flatmax and @madChopsCoderAu :
