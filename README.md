# we-have-been-flagged-again

Conflicting groups (outside github) have flagged my account for madChopsCoderAu

It is really unfortunate because I was just trying to make a common free space for Australian coders.
A space where money and corporations weren't in control.
A space where we could have fun, help each other and so on ....

If you want to help, please contact github and ask them to unflag and review @flatmax and @madChopsCoderAu :
